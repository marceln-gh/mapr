# Mapr

A simple object to object mapper without any of the magic configuration.

## Why Mapr?

- Does not rely on a naming contract for properties
- Mapping of immutable objects.
- Easily test and mock maps.
- Maps can be shared across projects.
- Simple Configuration.

Although there are many mapping libraries out there, Mapr takes a different approach. 
No Expression tree configuration or magic behind the scenes. Just a simple mapper.

## How does it work?

// Todo.. add example
